# SemanticUI-React + Webpack

This repository contains the bare minimum to get you going with [SemanticUI-React](https://react.semantic-ui.com), [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/), and [Storybook/react](https://storybook.js.org/basics/guide-react/). It builds upon another [minimal repository](https://github.com/sheljohn/minimal-semantic-react) without Storybook.

To run this example, simply type in a terminal:
```
git clone https://github.com/sheljohn/minimal-semantic-react
cd minimal-semantic-react/
yarn install
yarn run serve
```

This will open a page at `localhost:3000`, showing a marvellous button. 

 - You can use `npm` instead of `yarn` if you prefer.
 - You can change the port in `webpack.config.js`, section `devServer`.

That's all! Happy hacking :)
